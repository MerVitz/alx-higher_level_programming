## Project Overview

In this project, "Python - Everything is Object," I explored the concept of object instantiation in Python. The focus was on understanding variable aliasing, object identifiers, types, and mutability. This exploration was conducted through a series of quiz-like questions, the answers to which are provided in single-line `.txt` files.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for efficient and effective Python programming, especially in complex projects where object management is key.
