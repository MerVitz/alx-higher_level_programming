# Python - More Classes and Objects

In this project, I, Amakalu Vitalis, continue to practice object-oriented programming in Python. Throughout this project, I delve into advanced concepts such as class methods, static methods, class vs. instance attributes, and the utilization of special methods like `__str__` and `__repr__`.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): This folder contains test files, originally provided by Holberton School, and now tailored to fit the scope of this project.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

Here's an overview of the tasks I've completed in this project:

* **0. Simple rectangle**
  * [0-rectangle.py](./0-rectangle.py): An empty Python class that defines a rectangle.

* **1. Real definition of a rectangle**
  * [1-rectangle.py](./1-rectangle.py): This Python class defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, and their respective property getters and setters.

* **2. Area and Perimeter**
  * [2-rectangle.py](./2-rectangle.py): Enhancing the rectangle class to include methods for calculating its area and perimeter.

* **3. String representation**
  * [3-rectangle.py](./3-rectangle.py): A string representation of the rectangle using the `#` character.

* **4. Eval is magic**
  * [4-rectangle.py](./4-rectangle.py): Incorporating the `__repr__` method for a formal string representation of the rectangle.

* **5. Detect instance deletion**
  * [5-rectangle.py](./5-rectangle.py): Implementing the `__del__` method that prints a message upon the deletion of a `Rectangle` instance.

* **6. How many instances**
  * [6-rectangle.py](./6-rectangle.py): A class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep track of the number of `Rectangle` instances.

* **7. Change representation**
  * [7-rectangle.py](./7-rectangle.py): Introducing a class attribute `class_symbol` for flexible string representation.

* **8. Compare rectangles**
  * [8-rectangle.py](./8-rectangle.py): A static method for comparing the area of two rectangles.

* **9. A square is a rectangle**
  * [9-rectangle.py](./9-rectangle.py): A class method to create a square as a `Rectangle` instance.

* **10. N Queens**

  * [101-nqueens.py](./101-nqueens.py): A Python program that solves the N queens puzzle, with conditions for the input and a clear display of solutions.
