# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Introduction
This project, part of the ALX higher level programming series, focuses on Python data structures, particularly lists and tuples. Authored by Amakalu Vitalis and overseen by Guillaume, it aims to deepen understanding and practical application of these structures in Python programming.

## Resources
### Readings
- 3.1.3. Lists
- Data structures (up to 5.3. Tuples and Sequences)
- Learn to Program 6: Lists

## Learning Objectives
Post completion, learners should be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Usage and characteristics of lists and tuples
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Common methods of lists and their applications
- Implementing lists as stacks and queues
- Utilizing list comprehensions
- When to prefer tuples over lists and vice versa
- Concepts of sequence, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking
- Using the `del` statement in Python

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.5
- Style: pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- Files must be executable and end with a new line

### C
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.5
- Style: Betty style
- Restrictions: No global variables, max 5 functions per file
- Header file: `lists.h` (include-guarded)

## Tasks
1. **Print a List of Integers**: Implement a function that prints integers from a list.
2. **Secure Access to an Element in a List**: Retrieve an element from a list with boundary checks.
3. **Replace Element**: Function to replace an element in a list at a specific position.
4. **Print a List of Integers in Reverse**: Display all integers of a list in reverse order.
5. **Replace in a Copy**: Modify an element in a list without altering the original list.
6. **Can you C me now?**: Remove specific characters from
